### Install Instructions
- Clone the repo locally. Alternatively, a Zip file can be downloaded by clicking on the "Clone or Download" button but then you won't be able to collaborate.
- All functions and files should be kept in the folder `+e2at` this folder name tells MATLAB to treat the folder as a library.
- Add the `+e2at` folder and subfolders to the MATLAB path.
  - Type `pathtool` at the MATLAB prompt
  - choose `Add with Subfolders` and browse to the `+e2at` folder
- You should now be able to access the functions and scripts using, for example `e2at.symss` to create a symbolic state-space system
